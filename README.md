humanizing mouse movements with diffusion models
========================================
kinda works but still experimental


(the model is small enough for me to just push it to github. can't be bothered making a huggingface repo for it)

obviously, in this day and age of llms, some of this *is* vibe coded. shame, i know. shake me down if you must, but i'm a human after all...
